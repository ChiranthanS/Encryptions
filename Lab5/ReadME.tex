# SSL/TLS Certificate Setup Script

This script automates the process of setting up a Certificate Authority (CA) and configuring SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication in a multi-machine environment.

## Prerequisites

- Both the CA server and client server must have SSH access enabled.
- You should have sudo privileges on both machines.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the script's directory.

2. Modify the `folder_names` array to specify the directories you want to create on the CA server.

3. Execute the script, and it will perform the following tasks:

   - Create the main CA folder on the CA server.
   - Create specified folders within the CA directory.
   - Generate a self-signed CA certificate on the CA server.
   - Generate a certificate signing request (CSR) on the client server.
   - Transfer the CSR to the CA server.
   - Move the CSR to the CA's request folder.
   - Copy the private key to the CA's private folder.
   - Use the CA to sign the client's certificate.
   - Transfer the signed certificate and CA certificate to the client server.
   - Configure Apache to accept SSL/TLS connections on the client server.

## Notes

- This script is provided as a template and should be adapted to your specific environment and requirements.
- Ensure that you have a secure SSH connection and proper authentication.
- Review and customize the script for security and compliance with your organization's policies.
